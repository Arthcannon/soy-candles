### About candles

**In harmony with nature**

Advantages of soy candles: One of the advantages of soy wax is that a candle based on it perfectly captures the aroma of the added aromas. Natural soy wax brings out the aromas of fragrance compositions or essential oils added to them well. In addition, soy wax burns with a pure flame and does not show any tendency to smoke. Burning soybean candles produces much less soot than paraffin candles and produces less carbon dioxide.

Customize by yourself: All candles available from us are handmade by us. As a result, elements such as the intensity of color or fragrance can be individually adapted to your requirements. Just in the comment to the order or by e-mail tell us what you expect.
